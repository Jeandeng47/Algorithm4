# Stack, Queue, Array & Linked List
## All starting from Array & Linked List
- Array and Linkedlist are often referred to as sequential allocation and linked allocation. 
- Array's index provdies immediate access to any item, but user need to know size on initialization.
- Linked list uses space proportional to size, but reference is needed to access an item.

## More Data Structures in the Future
- The data structures in the rest of the books are developed using ideas of two most fundamental data structure: array and linked list.
- One extension is data with links, such as binary tree. 
- Another extension is composed data structure, such as bag of stacks, queue of arrays.
